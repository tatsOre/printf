A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.IP d,i

.IP c
Character. The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

.IP s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').

.IP o,u,x,X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions.
