## Why Use Structure
Structure is a user-defined datatype in C language which allows us to combine data of different types together. Structure helps to construct a complex data type which is more meaningful. It is somewhat similar to an Array, but an array holds data of similar type only. But structure on the other hand, can store data of any type, which is practical more useful.

## How To Use Typedef

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers

typedef unsigned char BYTE;
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
